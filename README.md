# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning Project Repository. This repository contains various projects that demonstrate my skills in Data Analysis (including Exploratory Data Analysis), Machine Learning (such as Model Fitting and Model Maintenance), and Artificial Intelligence (using Deep Learning techniques such as Neural Networks to constuct LLMs), in a more hands-on and practical approach.

## Projects

- e.g. [Project 1: Predicting Customer Churn](./project1/README.md)
- [Project 2: )
- [Project 3: )

Each project folder contains:
- A detailed project-specific README.md
- Jupyter Notebooks for Data Analysis and Modelling
- Python scripts for reproducibility
- Sample data (if applicable) and links to larger datasets
