# Data Science and Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Data Science and Machine Learning Project Repository. This repository contains various projects that demonstrate my skills in Data Analysis (including Exploratory Data Analysis), Machine Learning (such as Model Fitting and Model Maintenance), and Artificial Intelligence (using Deep Learning techniques such as Neural Networks to constuct LLMs), in a more hands-on and practical approach. Under the `Projects` Tab, there is a set of notebooks that provide a deep understanding of my knowledge in various concepts within Machine Learning and its applications to various datasets. The section is split based on the dataset, where each dataset has been analysed using various techniques of focus.

[This Repository is constantly being updated with new work!]
